Chatconnector.py is the WIP CLI tool for interacting with the chatbots. To use configure sample.ini with your uiuc chat API key and then simply call from the command line with:

```bash
python chatconnector.py "How many H200 nodes does Delta have?"
```

If you don't have an API key you can get one by creating an account at https://uiuc.chat and selecting the API tab were you can get your key.
